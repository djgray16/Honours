\graphCap{ID_low_gtype.pdf}{0.7}{Comparing Graph Models: Replicator Dynamics. Trend for $r \in \{4.0, 4.25, 4.5, 4.75\}$. In each graph, the blue circles, orange stars, green crosses, and red pentagons correspond to the WS model, TAG model, BA model, and RRG model respectively. It appears that the BA model induces the highest cooperation, then the TAG, followed by WS and RRG respectively. Observed cooperation correlates with degree size variance. It is interesting that the BA trend for $r=4.75$ is lower than the trend for $r=4.5$. This may be due to sampling variation. }{replicator_low}

In each graph, the blue circles, orange stars, green crosses, and red pentagons correspond to the WS model, TAG model, BA model, and RRG model respectively. For $r\geq 5.5$, the TAG model induces the highest cooperation.}{replicator_medium}

\graphCap{ID_high_gtype.pdf}{0.7}{Comparing Graph Models: Replicator Dynamics. Trend for $r \in \{6,6.5,7,7.5\}$. In each graph, the blue circles, orange stars, green crosses, and red pentagons correspond to the WS model, TAG model, BA model, and RRG model respectively. The TAG and RRG models overtake the BA model, while the WS model consistently induces the lowest cooperation amongst models. }{replicator_high}\FloatBarrier
